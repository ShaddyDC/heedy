//Opens StreamDB given urls to the SQL database used, to the redis instance and to the gnatsd messenger
//server.
//
//StreamDB can use both postgres and sqlite as its storage engine. To run StreamDB with sqlite, give a
//path to the database file ending with .db. If the file does not end in .db, use "sqlite://" in the path
//to make sure that is the database engine used:
//  streamdb.Open("sqlite://path/to/database","localhost:6379","localhost:4222")
//One important thing to note when running StreamDB with sqlite: Open() automatically starts RunWriter() in a goroutine
//on open, since it is assumed that this is the only object from which the database is accessed.
//
//The normal use case for StreamDB is postgres. For postgres, just use the url of the connection. If you are worried
//that StreamDB will mistake your url for a sqlite location, you can start your database string with "postgres://".
//An example of a postgres url will be:
//  streamdb.Open("postgres://username:password@localhost:port/databasename?sslmode=verify-full","localhost:6379","localhost:4222")
//If just running locally, then you can use:
//  streamdb.Open("postgres://localhost:52592/connectordb?sslmode=disable","localhost:6379","localhost:4222")
//The preceding command will use the database "connectordb" (which is assumed to have been created already) on the local machine.
//
//Finally, if running in postgres, then at least one process must be running the function RunWriter(). This function
//writes the database's internal data.

//StreamDB uses a batching mechanism for writing timestamps, where data is first written to redis, and then committed to
//an sql database in batches of size BATCH_SIZE (global var). This allows great insert speed as well as fantastic read speed on large
//ranges of data. RunWriter runs this 'batching' process, which happens in the background.
//When running a single instance with posgres, you need to call RunWriter once manually (as a goroutine). You do not need to
//run it if on sqlite, since it is run automatically.
//If running as a cluster, then it is probably a good idea to have RunWriter be run as an entirely separate process.
//
//For example:
//  db,_ := streamdb.Open("postgres://...",...)
//  go db.RunWriter()   //Run this right after starting StreamDB
//  ...
//  db.Close()
//
//If unsure as to whether you should call RunWriter, this is a good way to decide:
//Are you running StreamDB manually by yourself using postgres, and this is the only process? If so then yes.
//If you are just connecting to an already-running StreamDB and RunWriter is already running somewhere on
//this database, then NO.
