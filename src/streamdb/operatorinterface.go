// operations to be done on them collectively. It differs from the straight
// timebatchdb/userdb as it allows some checking to be done with regards to
// permissions and such beforehand. If at all possible you should use this
// interface to perform operations because it will remain stable, secure and
// independent of future backends we implement.
