/*
The starting point of the ConnectorDB frontend. This file does the following:
  - prepares the ServiceWorker (the serviceWorker is in ../app/serviceworker.js. It is
    not compiled into this bundle)
  - prepares redux, adds middlewares, and syncs it with the browser history (this is needed so that the router works
    correctly on the back button - since it is an SPA, we don't refresh the page when navigating)
  - registers all visualizations. This is done simply by importing datatypes/register.js
  - loads the app context into the store and into the state. The store holds cached users/devices/streams,
    and the state is the redux state. The context is passed in as json from ConnectorDB, and includes the
    current user, device, stream (if applicable), as well as the querying user and device.

After the setup, we are running in React. The main routing component that is invoked from this file is in App.js.
Look there to see how stuff is handled.
