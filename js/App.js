/*
  This component renders the main app theme (./theme/Theme.js), and shows the page relevant to the routing shown in the URL.

  App represents the expected routing of ConnectorDB, so that we can use the frontend as a single-page application.
  ConnectorDB's web frontend uses a /user/device/stream url handling. All of these are redirected to the same code
  by the frontend. This means that any part of the app could be queried.
  We use the react-router package to manage the urls, and to run the correct javascript for each route.
  All of these represent urls that are directly recognized by the ConnectorDB server.

  The App component is initialized in index.js. It is react's main entry point.
