                    <p>Most data will be gathered automatically by your devices, such as an android app, or the laptop logger. Make sure to download the

                        if you have not done so already. You can also create your own devices using the
                        <a href="https://connectordb-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">{" "}python client{" "}</a>. If you ever get lost, please refer to the

                    <p>Despite the automatic data gathering, it is very difficult to gain insight without having a supervision signal. This is where your manual input is useful. By creating ratings, you can rate your productivity, mood, or log other things, such as progress towards goals or a diary. By consistently doing this every day, over time, you will gain enough data to be able to perform in-depth analysis on what exactly influences your abilities.
