/*
  This is the main navigator shown for the index page /. This component chooses the correct page to set based upon the data
  it is getting.

  The component also performs further routing based upon the hash. This is because react-router does not
  support both normal and hash-based routing at the same time.
  All child pages are located in ./pages. This component can be throught of as an extension to the main app routing
  done in App.js, with additional querying for the user/device/stream.

  It also queries the user/device/stream-specific state from redux, so further children can just use the state without worrying
  about which user/device/stream it belongs to.
