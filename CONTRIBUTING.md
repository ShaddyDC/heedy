Pull requests and bug reports are welcome! Before posting your issue, make sure it doesn't exist yet.

ConnectorDB is split into several repositories. Post your issues and bug reports at the one most relevant
to your problem:
- https://github.com/connectordb/connectordb-frontend - the web interface (the thing you see in your browser)
- https://github.com/connectordb/pipescript - datasets and transforms
- https://github.com/connectordb/connectordb - the connectordb server itself, and questions that do not fit elsewhere
