Heedy Documentation
=================================

Heedy is an `open-source <https://github.com/heedy/heedy>`_ database built for storage and analysis of your personal data.
It provides a powerful plugin system, allowing easy integration with various services, as well as deep extensibility.

This documentation provides a description of heedy's features, as well as examples of their usage. Much of it is focused on programmers
and plugin-writers, to help them extend heedy.

.. note::
   The documentation is currently under construction. A first version is expected to be released with 0.4.0-alpha.2.
   Until then, expect many stub pages, as well as missing/incorrect content.
