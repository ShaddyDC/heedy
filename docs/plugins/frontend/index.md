# Frontend

A plugin performs all of its modifications to the heedy frontend through the use of 
a single javascript module. In the plugin's `heedy.conf`, the module is registered:
```javascript
plugin "myplugin" {
    frontend = "myplugin/main.mjs"
}
```
This means that heedy will look for a javascript module file served at `/static/myplugin/main.mjs`. While not strictly required, it is recommended that you prefix the module path with your plugin name (as was done here). Then, for heedy to serve the file at the correct location, you need to create a `main.mjs` file, and place it at `public/static/myplugin/main.mjs` in your plugin's folder. The minimal content of your main.mjs is the following:

```javascript
function setup(frontend) {
    // Initialize your plugin's frontend here
}
export default setup;
```

## The `frontend` object

Using the `frontend` object passed into your module's setup function, you can tell heedy's UI how to accommodate your plugin. The UI is built with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), so the frontend object allows you to directly deal with Vue components:

```javascript
function setup(frontend) {
    // Register a vuex store for your plugin (optional)
    frontend.store.registerModule("myplugin",vuexModule);
    // Add a route to the ui, which will be accessibe from `/#/myplugin/myroute`
    frontend.addRoute({
        path: "/myplugin/myroute",
        component: MyComponent
    });
    // Add an item to the main menu that will redirect to the registered route
    frontend.addMenuItem({
        key: "mypluginMenuItem",
        text: "My Plugin",
        icon: "home",
        route: "/myplugin/myroute",
        location: "primary"
    });
}
export default setup;
```

### Injected Functionality

Each heedy plugin can attach additional functionality to the frontend object (i.e. inject their own objects into the frontend). In a bare heedy install, the following registered classes extend the frontend's functionality:

```eval_rst
.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1
    
    users
    apps
    objects
    settings
    websocket
    worker
    timeseries
```

Each of these can be accessed as a property of the `frontend` object (ex: `frontend.websocket`, `frontend.worker`, `frontend.timeseries`).

### Frontend API

The following is the API documentation for the `frontend` object passed into the setup function.

```eval_rst
.. js:autoclass:: Frontend
    :members:
```
