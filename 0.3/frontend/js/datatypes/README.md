# datatypes

This directory contains the code modules used to display and view all of the data in ConnectorDB.

There are 3 types of modules:
- **creators** - special code used to create streams. It allows setting defaults and showing custom components for stream creation.
- **inputs** - allows showing custom input components by datatype. Being able to input star ratings by clicking on stars is exactly the type of thing these do (in particular the rating.stars plugin)
- **views** - ALL of the frontend's visualizations. Every method of plotting or viewing your data is a plugin located in views
